# :wave: Work Package 1 Demostration project 4 :pregnant_woman: :breast_feeding:
This demonstration project will show how we can include intensity and timing of use of medications during pregnancy. This project will use novel techniques including longitudinal trajectories and drug burden index which may offer great advantages as they can model real-life medication usage patterns across pregnancy. We will incorporate novel data visualisation tools with analytical techniques to study complex patterns of medication utilisation before and throughout pregnancy. The example for this study is migraine and included both immediate maternal and child outcomes and child long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.
